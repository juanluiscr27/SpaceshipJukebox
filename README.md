# Spaceship Jukebox

-----
This project look for setting a practice on how the Object-Oriented Analysis and Design process
works. Here we go from each stage, from the customer requirements to the coding phase in the programming
language we choose.

The astronauts need some music for their long journey to the moon. So we need your help to design a
jukebox for our moon shuttle. As astronauts don't carry money with them, this jukebox will
be free to use. But we don't want to let just one person pick all the music and drive the others crazy.

The jukebox should let a user select an album from the available music library, and then choose
individual songs from that album to be played. And as an extra precaution, if one astronaut adds more
than three songs in a row to the play queue, and another astronaut wants to play a song, they'll jump
ahead in line.

First, write a set of requirements to design the jukebox. Try to come up with at least three functional
and three non-functional requirements. Use the attributes of FURPS+ to inspire possible requirements.
