# Object-Oriented Design

-----
## Software Development Fundamentals
Object-oriented design helps developers plan applications before they write a single line of code,
and break down ideas into reusable and maintainable components. This course focuses on the
foundational concepts, teaching them in a fun, interactive way to help you quickly develop your skills.

It shows how to take the requirements for an app, identify use cases, and map out classes using
Universal Modeling Language (UML). The final design can then be translated into code using one of
the many popular object-oriented programming languages, such as Java, C#, Ruby, or Python.

Here it introduces to the following concepts and terms:

Object-oriented basics: objects, classes, properties and methods
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Defining requirements
Identifying use cases, actors, and scenarios
Domain modeling
Identifying class responsibilities and relationships
Creating class diagrams
Using abstract classes
Working with inheritance
Developing software with object-oriented design principles
